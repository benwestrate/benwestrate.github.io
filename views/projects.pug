                            p Iron(Fe) is an opinionated yet flexible Front End development framework.
                            p The goal is for Iron(FE) to be a foundation for projects.Â As a foundation, Iron(Fe) is just the beginning. Iron makes some foundational decisions, then the developer has the freedom to go in many directions. I want to give front end developers who work with AEM access to the same tools I have when working outside AEM.
